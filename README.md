# my-first-webs
it is a first four months on learning  programing, it was hard but finally i can write my own code without using too much tutorial

I relied on this to create my project, this is not my own code, I just read it and tried to understand it and yes, I did it in my first month, it was amazing for me, so I got confidence after that, <strong>I made my v1 for text-to-speech</strong> of my friends at the university, so I modified creating a new element like the button in English and Spanish, adding the logo of my universitys 

then for two weeks worked to improve my page therefore I finished it, added more languages and used bootstrap 4
